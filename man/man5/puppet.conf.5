.IP "\(bu" 4
Each of these settings can be specified in \fBpuppet\.conf\fR or on the command line\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Puppet Enterprise (PE) and open source Puppet share the configuration settings that are documented here\. However, PE defaults for some settings differ from the open source Puppet defaults\. Some examples of settings that have different PE defaults include \fBdisable18n\fR, \fBenvironment_timeout\fR, \fBalways_retry_plugins\fR, and the Puppet Server JRuby \fBmax\-active\-instances\fR setting\. To verify PE configuration defaults, check the \fBpuppet\.conf\fR file after installation\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When using boolean settings on the command line, use \fB\-\-setting\fR and \fB\-\-no\-setting\fR instead of \fB\-\-setting (true|false)\fR\. (Using \fB\-\-setting false\fR results in "Error: Could not parse application options: needless argument"\.)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Settings can be interpolated as \fB$variables\fR in other settings; \fB$environment\fR is special, in that puppet master will interpolate each agent node\'s environment instead of its own\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Multiple values should be specified as comma\-separated lists; multiple directories should be separated with the system path separator (usually a colon)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Settings that represent time intervals should be specified in duration format: an integer immediately followed by one of the units \'y\' (years of 365 days), \'d\' (days), \'h\' (hours), \'m\' (minutes), or \'s\' (seconds)\. The unit cannot be combined with other units, and defaults to seconds when omitted\. Examples are \'3600\' which is equivalent to \'1h\' (one hour), and \'1825d\' which is equivalent to \'5y\' (5 years)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you use the \fBsplay\fR setting, note that the period that it waits changes each time the Puppet agent is restarted\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Settings that take a single file or directory can optionally set the owner, group, and mode for their value: \fBrundir = $vardir/run { owner = puppet, group = puppet, mode = 644 }\fR

.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIDefault\fR: false
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "always_retry_plugins"
Affects how we cache attempts to load Puppet resource types and features\. If true, then calls to \fBPuppet\.type\.<type>?\fR \fBPuppet\.feature\.<feature>?\fR will always attempt to load the type or feature (which can be an expensive operation) unless it has already been loaded successfully\. This makes it possible for a single agent run to, e\.g\., install a package that provides the underlying capabilities for a type or feature, and then later load that type or feature during the same run (even if the type or feature had been tested earlier and had not been available)\.
.
.P
If this setting is set to false, then types and features will only be checked once, and if they are not available, the negative result is cached and returned for all subsequent attempts to load the type or feature\. This behavior is almost always appropriate for the server, and can result in a significant performance improvement for types and features that are checked frequently\.

.
.SS "autosign"
Whether (and how) to autosign certificate requests\. This setting is only relevant on a puppet master acting as a certificate authority (CA)\.
.
.P
Valid values are true (autosigns all certificate requests; not recommended), false (disables autosigning certificates), or the absolute path to a file\.
.
.P
The file specified in this setting may be either a \fBconfiguration file\fR or a \fBcustom policy executable\.\fR Puppet will automatically determine what it is: If the Puppet user (see the \fBuser\fR setting) can execute the file, it will be treated as a policy executable; otherwise, it will be treated as a config file\.
.
.P
If a custom policy executable is configured, the CA puppet master will run it every time it receives a CSR\. The executable will be passed the subject CN of the request \fIas a command line argument,\fR and the contents of the CSR in PEM format \fIon stdin\.\fR It should exit with a status of 0 if the cert should be autosigned and non\-zero if the cert should not be autosigned\.
.
.P
If a certificate request is not autosigned, it will persist for review\. An admin user can use the \fBpuppetserver ca sign\fR command to manually sign it, or can delete the request\.
.

.
.SS "certificate_revocation"
Whether certificate revocation checking should be enabled, and what level of checking should be performed\.
.
.P
When certificate revocation is enabled Puppet expects the contents of its CRL to be one or more PEM encoded CRLs concatenated together\. When using a cert bundle CRLs for all CAs in the chain of trust must be included in the crl file with the first CRL listed being for the root of the chain, the last being for the leaf CA\.
.
.P
When certificate_revocation is set to \'true\' or \'chain\', Puppet will ensure that each CA in the chain of trust has not been revoked by its issuing CA\.
.
.P
When certificate_revocation is set to \'leaf\', Puppet will verify certs against the issuing CA\'s revocation list but not verify the revocation status of the issuing CA or any CA above it within the chain of trust\.
.
.P
When certificate_revocation is set to \'false\', Puppet will disable all certificate revocation checking and will not attempt to download the CRL\.

.
.SS "certname"
The name to use when handling certificates\. When a node requests a certificate from the CA puppet master, it uses the value of the \fBcertname\fR setting as its requested Subject CN\.
.
.P
This is the name used when managing a node\'s permissions in auth\.conf \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_auth\.html\fR\. In most cases, it is also used as the node\'s name when matching node definitions \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_node_definitions\.html\fR and requesting data from an ENC\. (This can be changed with the \fBnode_name_value\fR and \fBnode_name_fact\fR settings, although you should only do so if you have a compelling reason\.)
.
.P
A node\'s certname is available in Puppet manifests as \fB$trusted[\'certname\']\fR\. (See Facts and Built\-In Variables \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars\.html\fR for more details\.)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For best compatibility, you should limit the value of \fBcertname\fR to only use lowercase letters, numbers, periods, underscores, and dashes\. (That is, it should match \fB/A[a\-z0\-9\._\-]+Z/\fR\.)

Code to parse directly\. This is essentially only used by \fBpuppet\fR, and should only be set if you\'re writing your own Puppet executable\.
.
.SS "codedir"
The main Puppet code directory\. The default for this setting is calculated based on the user\. If the process is running as root or the user that Puppet is supposed to run as, it defaults to a system directory, but if it\'s running as any other user, it defaults to being in the user\'s home directory\.

.SS "config_version"
How to determine the configuration version\. By default, it will be the time that the configuration is parsed, but you can provide a shell script to override how the version is determined\. The output of this script will be added to every log message in the reports, allowing you to correlate changes on your hosts to the source version on the server\.
.
.P
Setting a global value for config_version in puppet\.conf is not allowed (but it can be overridden from the commandline)\. Please set a per\-environment value in environment\.conf instead\. For more info, see \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/environments_about\.html\fR
.
.SS "configprint"
Prints the value of a specific configuration setting\. If the name of a setting is provided for this, then the value is printed and puppet exits\. Comma\-separate multiple values\. For a list of all values, specify \'all\'\. This setting is deprecated, the \'puppet config\' command replaces this functionality\.
.
.SS "csr_attributes"
An optional file containing custom attributes to add to certificate signing requests (CSRs)\. You should ensure that this file does not exist on your CA puppet master; if it does, unwanted certificate extensions may leak into certificates created with the \fBpuppetserver ca generate\fR command\.
.
.P
If present, this file must be a YAML hash containing a \fBcustom_attributes\fR key and/or an \fBextension_requests\fR key\. The value of each key must be a hash, where each key is a valid OID and each value is an object that can be cast to a string\.
.
.P
Custom attributes can be used by the CA when deciding whether to sign the certificate, but are then discarded\. Attribute OIDs can be any OID value except the standard CSR attributes (i\.e\. attributes described in RFC 2985 section 5\.4)\. This is useful for embedding a pre\-shared key for autosigning policy executables (see the \fBautosign\fR setting), often by using the \fB1\.2\.840\.113549\.1\.9\.7\fR ("challenge password") OID\.
.
.P
Extension requests will be permanently embedded in the final certificate\. Extension OIDs must be in the "ppRegCertExt" (\fB1\.3\.6\.1\.4\.1\.34380\.1\.1\fR) or "ppPrivCertExt" (\fB1\.3\.6\.1\.4\.1\.34380\.1\.2\fR) OID arcs\. The ppRegCertExt arc is reserved for four of the most common pieces of data to embed: \fBpp_uuid\fR (\fB\.1\fR), \fBpp_instance_id\fR (\fB\.2\fR), \fBpp_image_name\fR (\fB\.3\fR), and \fBpp_preshared_key\fR (\fB\.4\fR) \-\-\- in the YAML file, these can be referred to by their short descriptive names instead of their full OID\. The ppPrivCertExt arc is unregulated, and can be used for site\-specific extensions\.

.SS "dns_alt_names"
A comma\-separated list of alternate DNS names for Puppet Server\. These are extra hostnames (in addition to its \fBcertname\fR) that the server is allowed to use when serving agents\. Puppet checks this setting when automatically creating a certificate for Puppet agent or Puppet Server\. These can be either IP or DNS, and the type should be specified and followed with a colon\. Untyped inputs will default to DNS\.
.
.P
In order to handle agent requests at a given hostname (like "puppet\.example\.com"), Puppet Server needs a certificate that proves it\'s allowed to use that name; if a server shows a certificate that doesn\'t include its hostname, Puppet agents will refuse to trust it\. If you use a single hostname for Puppet traffic but load\-balance it to multiple Puppet Servers, each of those servers needs to include the official hostname in its list of extra names\.
.
.P
\fBNote:\fR The list of alternate names is locked in when the server\'s certificate is signed\. If you need to change the list later, you can\'t just change this setting; you also need to regenerate the certificate\. For more information on that process, see the [cert regen docs] (https://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/ssl_regenerate_certificates\.html)\.
.
.P
To see all the alternate names your servers are using, log into your CA server and run \fBpuppetserver ca list \-\-all\fR, then check the output for \fB(alt names: \.\.\.)\fR\. Most agent nodes should NOT have alternate names; the only certs that should have them are Puppet Server nodes that you want other agents to trust\.

.SS "environment"
The environment in which Puppet is running\. For clients, such as \fBpuppet agent\fR, this determines the environment itself, which Puppet uses to find modules and much more\. For servers, such as \fBpuppet master\fR, this provides the default environment for nodes that Puppet knows nothing about\.
.
.P
When defining an environment in the \fB[agent]\fR section, this refers to the environment that the agent requests from the master\. The environment doesn\'t have to exist on the local filesystem because the agent fetches it from the master\. This definition is used when running \fBpuppet agent\fR\.
.
.P
When defined in the \fB[user]\fR section, the environment refers to the path that Puppet uses to search for code and modules related to its execution\. This requires the environment to exist locally on the filesystem where puppet is being executed\. Puppet subcommands, including \fBpuppet module\fR and \fBpuppet apply\fR, use this definition\.
.
.P
Given that the context and effects vary depending on the config section \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_main\.html#config\-sections\fR in which the \fBenvironment\fR setting is defined, do not set it globally\.

You should change this setting once your Puppet deployment is doing non\-trivial work\. We chose the default value of \fB0\fR because it lets new users update their code without any extra steps, but it lowers the performance of your Puppet master\.

For example, assume a default 30\-minute \fB$runinterval\fR, \fBsplay\fR set to its default of \fBfalse\fR, and an agent starting at :00 past the hour\. The agent would check in every 30 minutes at :01 and :31 past the hour\.

If you restart an agent\'s puppet service with \fBsplay\fR enabled, it recalculates its splay period and delays its first agent run after restarting for this new period\.
